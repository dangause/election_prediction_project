## Election Prediction Project

This is the final project for my Statistical Learning class (Spring 2020) at
Middlebury College. I used a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning
techniques to predict presidential election results based on county 
demographics in the United States. This repository includes a *datasets* 
directory which holds all of the .csv datasets used, the R markdown file with 
my final code, a pdf of the final project, and the knitted html file in the
docs directory. The knitted html paper can
 be viewed [here](https://dangause.github.io/election_prediction_project/)
